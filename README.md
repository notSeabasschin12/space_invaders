# space_invaders
Source code to create a video game similar to Space Invaders. Files app.py, consts.py, models.py, and wave.py were modified by me and my partner to make the game. The GUI was provided already by the CS 1110 instructors. 

In this repository, I have only put the files that I have modified. Folders containing information in game effects, images, and fonts are not included.

Files:
app.py: creates a frame to play the video game in and controls the states of the alien wave.
consts.py: contains constants for image characeristics and alien wave size.
models.py: contains classes for aliens, the ship, and firing bolts.
wave.py: the file in which most coding was done. Contains functions to control the movement of a wave, check to see if an alien is hit by a bolt, and display the score and lives remaining.
