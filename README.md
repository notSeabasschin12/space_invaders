# space_invaders
Source code to create a video game similar to Space Invaders. Files app.py, consts.py, models.py, and wave.py were modified by me and my partner to make the game. The GUI was provided already by the CS 1110 instructors. 
In this repository, I have only put the files that I have modified. Folders containing information in game effects, images, and fonts are not included.
